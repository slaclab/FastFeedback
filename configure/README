How to specify/reference non-EPICS modules/packages?
We use "CONFIG_SITE" to add location to packages 
needed by the host build.

Then we use "CONFIG_SITE.Common.<Target_Arch>"

For example, "CONFIG_SITE.Common.linuxRT_glibc-x86_64"

The RELEASE file is really reserved for specifying the location
of EPICS modules.

This APP will need the following packages:
(1) CPPUNIT
(2) BOOST
(3) BOOSTBINDINGS
(4) LAPACK
