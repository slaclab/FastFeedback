  CATER: 138128

FastFeedback-R1-0-20 20-Mar-2018  James Luong (ajluong)
  Add sioc-sys0-fb01 for convergence functionality.
  CATER: 138128
  *DO NOT USE THIS TAG

FastFeedback-R1-0-19 13-Feb-2018  Jeremy Mock (JMOCK)
  Change Longitudinal::updateActuator() so that the offset PV is
  directly applied to the actuator value sent on fcom.  This will
  allow users to put in offsets for different patterns.

FastFeedback-R1-0-18 22-Aug-2017  Jeremy Mock (JMOCK)
  Fix fastFeedBackApp/src/framework/Loop.cc (and many other places)
    The function call to "evrTimePutPulseID" was not applied in all
    cases for linux builds (only applied with #ifdef for RTEMS builds).
    When the code was written, linux support for evr was not available,
    so when running on linux, the pulse ID was not applied to the
    end of the timestamp.  The BLD IOC was checking for the pulse ID, not
    finding the correct one, and rejecting the data from the FBCK:FB05:TR05
    (fast Undulator).  This #ifdef condition has been removed from everywhere
    it appeared. 

FastFeedback-R1-0-17 22-Aug-2017  Jeremy Mock (JMOCK)
  Fix vioc-sys0-lgo1/st-on.cmd broken link in PHASE_LNK

FastFeedback-R1-0-16 19-Jul-2017  Jeremy Mock (JMOCK)
  Fix vioc-sys0-lg01/st.cmd invocation of 3 state functions:
      Passing the the wrong macros causing the sequences to run incorrectly
  Fix common/st.cmd to include a macro "LOCA_NAME" which was needed to run
      LoopConfiguration.cc correctly - causing seg faults in vioc-und1-tr02
  Change to seq version R2.2.4-1.0 which dumps any issues while running

FastFeedback-R1-0-15 22-May-2017  Jeremy Mock (JMOCK)
  Add vioc-bsy0-tr02 to accomodate reconfiguration of BSY

FastFeedback-R1-0-14:
   Updated st.cmd to take into account EVR-related, unique PV names
   Updated st-on.cmd and st-off.cmd for same reason
   Modified fbck_template.substitutions to remove LG PVs from common file
      Place generation of those PVs in vioc-sys0-lg01 startup script
   Added support for viocs to ntwk_bsy0_main.edl screen
FastFeedback-R1-0-13:

   ---Future Planning -----------------------------------------
   * <Indicates planfbck_template.substitutionsned for this release, but still being actively worked on>
   Moved FCOM parameter configuration out of common/st.cmd into kernel-modules.cmd (epics application should be environment agnostic)
   Revert back to original PV Names for feedback loops (keep new vioc names)
   Updated EVR-related PV names to make them unique based on vioc (to avoid PV duplication)
   Remove display/ directory and all edm displays with new names (revert to old names and keep current displays) 
   Switching scripts here 
   Note: kernel version (buildroot-2015.02-x86_64) + epics version R3-14-12-4_1-1 

FastFeedback-R1-0-12:
   OLDER Kernel + OLDER epics version
   Tested Longitudinal feedback in development (reading/writing) to files
   Fixed missing sequences in st.cmd for Longitudinal feedback 
   Missing register calls for limitUpdate.st and chirpUpdate.st
   Tested Longitudinal feedback in development (reading/writing) to files
   Fixed missing sequences in st.cmd for Longitudinal feedback 
   Missing register calls for limitUpdate.st and chirpUpdate.st
   Addition of iocBoot/common/st-off.cmd, which is used by the
   $TOOLS/script/switchFF.sh script


FastFeedback-R1-0-11:
   Migrate to new kernel version (buildroot-2015.02-x86_64) + epics version R3-14-12-4_1-1 
   Also includes fixed sequences for Longitudinal feedbacks

FastFeedback-R1-0-10:
   Saved tagged version before kernel migration
   Fixed all the java configration command shell buttons (parameters in input positions 1 and 3 required an update based on PV name change)
   Added missing screens for LI28:TR01 (changed PV names, java configuration command shell buttons, etc) 

FastFeedback-R1-0-09:
   --- 23-MAR-2016 -----------------------------------------
   Identical to FastFeedback-R1-0-8, EXCEPT ACTUATORS ENABLED for POMM testing

FastFeedback-R1-0-8:
   --- 15-MAR-2016 -----------------------------------------
   Added all directory structures for cpu-sys0-fb02 (under $IOC, $IOC_DATA, and iocBoot directory)
   Changed vioc-li25-tr01 to vioc-li24-tr01 to remove any potential confusion and leave the feedback loop under the li24 area versus moving it to li25
   Updated corresponding display and st.cmd files with any reference to li25 => li24
   Need "OLD GLOBAL PAGE..." on fbck_global.edl (to be able to configure MATLAB Bunch Charge feedback loop, which apparently has better performance than the RTEMS one)
   Put banner across "lcls-global-old".edl page (only use if configuring MATLAB feedback loop)
   Updated PV's in screens (excluding the alarm PV's/Visability PV's - update alarm handler at a later date in time) 
   NO ACTUATOR VERSION

FastFeedback-R1-0-7:
    --- 09-MAR-2016---------------------------------------------
    Same as tagged version 6, EXCEPT ACTUATORS ENABLED

FastFeedback-R1-0-6:
    --- 09-MAR-2016---------------------------------------------
    Updated timer functionality to fix timer mismatch between BPM measurement's timestamp and application timestamp.
    Included new directory (display) for all the feedback displays (with new PV names + *Started* PV updates in the command 
    shell button, which call the java configuration matrix.)
    Fixed type with SIOC:SYS0:FB00:TMITLOW (also double checked other PV's)
    Removed debugging messages.
    NO ACTUATOR VERSION

FastFeedback-R1-0-5:
    --- 15-FEB-2016---------------------------------------------
    Updated development vioc names to match production, configured two additional vioc/vevr's, 
    and recompiled application with appropriate compiler flags for no actuator inputs on production. 
    Santitized application to remove all instances of the DLINUX compiler flag and corresponding #ifdef <token> 
    structure that was carryover from heritage linux/RTEMS version of the application.
    Tested with FCOM channels/verify that FCOM channels work on linux architecture
    Fixed macro substitution errors  - had to remove comment that contained an epicsEnvSet 

FastFeedback-R1-0-4:
    --- 15-DEC-2015 --------------------------------------------
    Time to clean-up fastFeedbackApp/Db/common 
    1) Remove unused databases - fbckLTU.substitutions, fbckLNG.substitutions
    2) Fix macro substitution error => hardcoded PV's LG01 => user defined feedback loop type
    3) Update to using macros for entire ioc name - IOC:SYS0 => ${VIOC}:${LOCA}
    Colapse files in fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs to just fbck_template.substitutions
    (removed seperate file for long_template.substitutions)
    Design Rationale: Seperating trajecotry, general, and 
    longitudinal specific parameters would require extensive modifications
    to most database under /Db as well as all the C++ code.  Will procede
    with one generic fbck_template.substitutions file that works for all feedback
    types until further architecture changes are needed due to performance (not anticipating
    the increased network load to justify a complete re-architecture)
    4) Updated R1-0-p3 to evrma-R1-0-p4 for consistency between version numbers
    5) Generated new README file under iocBoot with more detailed information regarding 
       st.cmd updates
    6) Generated new /iocBoot/common/st.cmd, which is a generic st.cmd that applies to all 
       feedback loops.  Each vioc specific st.cmd contains vioc/feedback specific parameters and
       calls the generic st.cmd. 

FastFeedback-R1-0-3:
    --- 02-DEC-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    This version contains loop splitting in the st.cmd file and 
    epics modules.
    Updated configure/RELEASE to use latest evrClient-R1-0-p4 and 
    updated UDPCOMM, FCOM, and FCOMUTIL to utilize changes to 
    udpcomm for sharing across mulitple vioc's on a host cpu.
    Also, generated four new vioc's for testing on development.
    Renamed generic substitution files in fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs.
    Updated st.cmd so all loop specific parameters are defined by 
    variables in the first section.
    Cleaned-up for loop splitting and removed any hard-coded references
    to loops. (just one loop is now configured in the st.cmd and the 
    same st.cmd can be used for any loop).


FastFeedback-R1-0-2:
    --- 24-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    Performed major clean-up and removed all older ioc's and sioc's. 
    This version has two vioc's (vioc-b34-fb01) and (vioc-b34-fb02).
    Also, cleaned up fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs and created generic 
    feedback loop substitutions file and evr substitutions files.  
    Cleaned up the iocBoot/vioc-b34-fb## st.cmd to use macro substitution
    for dbLoadRecords

FastFeedback-R1-0-1:
    --- 18-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    This verion has a working evrsharing module. 
    Incorperated new evrsharing module evrClient (R1-0-p3) and 
    updated UDPCOMM, FCOM, and FCOMUTIL module.


FastFeedback-R1-0-0:
	--- 06-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
	This version now runs on LinuxRT. The Timer class has been
	changed to use clock_nanosleep() instead of the RTEMS BSP
	timer. There have been also a few bug fixes in the TimeUtil.cc
	file (div by zero problems). Several #ifdef LINUX/RTEMS were
	removed.


FastFeedback: Initial import, based on FFController-R1-19-1
