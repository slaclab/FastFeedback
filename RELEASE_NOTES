FastFeedback-R1-0-4:
    --- In Progress ---
    Time to clean-up fastFeedbackApp/Db/common 
    1) Remove unused databases
    2) Fix macro substitution error => hardcoded PV's LG01 => user defined feedback loop type
    3) Update to using macros for entire ioc name - IOC:SYS0 => ${VIOC}:${LOCA}
    Colapse files in fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs to just fbck_template.substitutions
    (removed seperate file for long_template.substitutions)
    Design Rationale: Seperating trajecotry, general, and 
    longitudinal specific parameters would require extensive modifications
    to most database under /Db as well as all the C++ code.  Will procede
    with one generic fbck_template.substitutions file that works for all feedback
    types until further architecture changes are needed due to performance (not anticipating
    the increased network load to justify a complete re-architecture)


FastFeedback-R1-0-3:
    --- 02-DEC-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    This version contains loop splitting in the st.cmd file and 
    epics modules.
    Updated configure/RELEASE to use latest evrClient-R1-0-p4 and 
    updated UDPCOMM, FCOM, and FCOMUTIL to utilize changes to 
    udpcomm for sharing across mulitple vioc's on a host cpu.
    Also, generated four new vioc's for testing on development.
    Renamed generic substitution files in fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs.
    Updated st.cmd so all loop specific parameters are defined by 
    variables in the first section.
    Cleaned-up for loop splitting and removed any hard-coded references
    to loops. (just one loop is now configured in the st.cmd and the 
    same st.cmd can be used for any loop).


FastFeedback-R1-0-2:
    --- 24-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    Performed major clean-up and removed all older ioc's and sioc's. 
    This version has two vioc's (vioc-b34-fb01) and (vioc-b34-fb02).
    Also, cleaned up fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs and created generic 
    feedback loop substitutions file and evr substitutions files.  
    Cleaned up the iocBoot/vioc-b34-fb## st.cmd to use macro substitution
    for dbLoadRecords

FastFeedback-R1-0-1:
    --- 18-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    This verion has a working evrsharing module. 
    Incorperated new evrsharing module evrClient (R1-0-p3) and 
    updated UDPCOMM, FCOM, and FCOMUTIL module.


FastFeedback-R1-0-0:
	--- 06-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
	This version now runs on LinuxRT. The Timer class has been
	changed to use clock_nanosleep() instead of the RTEMS BSP
	timer. There have been also a few bug fixes in the TimeUtil.cc
	file (div by zero problems). Several #ifdef LINUX/RTEMS were
	removed.


FastFeedback: Initial import, based on FFController-R1-19-1
