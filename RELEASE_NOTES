FastFeedback-R1-0-9:
   ---Future Planning -----------------------------------------
   Migrate to new kernel version 
   Need to fix the alarm and some visability PV's still on the displays based on the new PV names (Use the :FB02:)

FastFeedback-R1-0-8:
   --- Future Planning -----------------------------------------
   * <Indicates planned for this release, but still being actively worked on>
   *Added all directory structures for cpu-sys0-fb02
   Changed vioc-li25-tr01 to vioc-li24-tr01 to remove any potential confusion and leave the feedback loop under the li24 area versus moving it to li25
   Updated corresponding display and st.cmd files with any reference to li25 => li24
   Need "OLD GLOBAL PAGE..." on fbck_global.edl (to be able to configure MATLAB Bunch Charge feedback loop, which apparently has better performance than the RTEMS one)
   *Put banner across "lcls-global-old".edl page (only use if configuring MATLAB feedback loop)
   *Fixed all the java configration command shell buttons (parameters in input positions 1 and 3 required an update based on PV name change)
   Updated PV's in screens (excluding the alarm PV's/Visability PV's - update alarm handler at a later date in time) 
   NO ACTUATOR VERSION

FastFeedback-R1-0-7:
    --- 09-MAR-2016---------------------------------------------
    Same as tagged version 6, EXCEPT ACTUATORS ENABLED

FastFeedback-R1-0-6:
    --- 09-MAR-2016---------------------------------------------
    Updated timer functionality to fix timer mismatch between BPM measurement's timestamp and application timestamp.
    Included new directory (display) for all the feedback displays (with new PV names + *Started* PV updates in the command 
    shell button, which call the java configuration matrix.)
    Fixed type with SIOC:SYS0:FB00:TMITLOW (also double checked other PV's)
    Removed debugging messages.
    NO ACTUATOR VERSION

FastFeedback-R1-0-5:
    --- 15-FEB-2016---------------------------------------------
    Updated development vioc names to match production, configured two additional vioc/vevr's, 
    and recompiled application with appropriate compiler flags for no actuator inputs on production. 
    Santitized application to remove all instances of the DLINUX compiler flag and corresponding #ifdef <token> 
    structure that was carryover from heritage linux/RTEMS version of the application.
    Tested with FCOM channels/verify that FCOM channels work on linux architecture
    Fixed macro substitution errors  - had to remove comment that contained an epicsEnvSet 

FastFeedback-R1-0-4:
    --- 15-DEC-2015 --------------------------------------------
    Time to clean-up fastFeedbackApp/Db/common 
    1) Remove unused databases - fbckLTU.substitutions, fbckLNG.substitutions
    2) Fix macro substitution error => hardcoded PV's LG01 => user defined feedback loop type
    3) Update to using macros for entire ioc name - IOC:SYS0 => ${VIOC}:${LOCA}
    Colapse files in fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs to just fbck_template.substitutions
    (removed seperate file for long_template.substitutions)
    Design Rationale: Seperating trajecotry, general, and 
    longitudinal specific parameters would require extensive modifications
    to most database under /Db as well as all the C++ code.  Will procede
    with one generic fbck_template.substitutions file that works for all feedback
    types until further architecture changes are needed due to performance (not anticipating
    the increased network load to justify a complete re-architecture)
    4) Updated R1-0-p3 to evrma-R1-0-p4 for consistency between version numbers
    5) Generated new README file under iocBoot with more detailed information regarding 
       st.cmd updates
    6) Generated new /iocBoot/common/st.cmd, which is a generic st.cmd that applies to all 
       feedback loops.  Each vioc specific st.cmd contains vioc/feedback specific parameters and
       calls the generic st.cmd. 

FastFeedback-R1-0-3:
    --- 02-DEC-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    This version contains loop splitting in the st.cmd file and 
    epics modules.
    Updated configure/RELEASE to use latest evrClient-R1-0-p4 and 
    updated UDPCOMM, FCOM, and FCOMUTIL to utilize changes to 
    udpcomm for sharing across mulitple vioc's on a host cpu.
    Also, generated four new vioc's for testing on development.
    Renamed generic substitution files in fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs.
    Updated st.cmd so all loop specific parameters are defined by 
    variables in the first section.
    Cleaned-up for loop splitting and removed any hard-coded references
    to loops. (just one loop is now configured in the st.cmd and the 
    same st.cmd can be used for any loop).


FastFeedback-R1-0-2:
    --- 24-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    Performed major clean-up and removed all older ioc's and sioc's. 
    This version has two vioc's (vioc-b34-fb01) and (vioc-b34-fb02).
    Also, cleaned up fastFeedbackApp/Db/iocs and created generic 
    feedback loop substitutions file and evr substitutions files.  
    Cleaned up the iocBoot/vioc-b34-fb## st.cmd to use macro substitution
    for dbLoadRecords

FastFeedback-R1-0-1:
    --- 18-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
    This verion has a working evrsharing module. 
    Incorperated new evrsharing module evrClient (R1-0-p3) and 
    updated UDPCOMM, FCOM, and FCOMUTIL module.


FastFeedback-R1-0-0:
	--- 06-NOV-2015 ---------------------------------------------
	This version now runs on LinuxRT. The Timer class has been
	changed to use clock_nanosleep() instead of the RTEMS BSP
	timer. There have been also a few bug fixes in the TimeUtil.cc
	file (div by zero problems). Several #ifdef LINUX/RTEMS were
	removed.


FastFeedback: Initial import, based on FFController-R1-19-1
